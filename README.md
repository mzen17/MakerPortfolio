# MakerPortfolio
A repo to store videos, documents, or files of large projects that I have been doing throughout high school.

## Planned Projects on Here. They will all be posted before Jan 6.
- Homelab (Purpose, pictures, tech stack, etc)
- LTW (Trailer Video, some gameplay demo, process, etc)
- ATHR Project (Advancing Towards Human Recreation, papers + whatnot))

## FAQ
### What is this place for?
- A quick skim of my projects w/o needing to look through code.
- A way for me to reflect on what I've actually accomplished & successfully built.
- College app requirements (particularly MIT, this got me thinking to actually make on of these).

### Why not a google drive?
> Google drive is a pain to use for websites (it has strict rate limits). If I place videos here, I can have a URL point to them without problems.

### Why not youtube?
This videos are likely unedited.
